Springboot

what is springboot
springboot is a popular framework for building java based applications.
with springboot you don't need to focus on extensive application configuration.
springboot helps to build production ready application with minimal effort by providing the configurations and everything that can run independently without an external server, springboot provides an embedded tomcat server for you to run your application.
springboot simplifies the development by providing pre-configurations and eliminates boiler plate code.


key features:
Autoconfiguration: Spring Boot automatically configures the application based on the dependencies you add to your project. This feature eliminates the need for explicit configuration, speeding up development.

Standalone: Spring Boot applications can be run as standalone Java applications. You don't need to deploy the app to an external server like Tomcat or JBoss. Instead, it includes an embedded server that starts when you run the application.

Spring Boot Starter Projects: Starters are a set of convenient dependency descriptors you can include in your application. For example, spring-boot-starter-web brings in all the dependencies you need to build a web app, like Spring MVC and an embedded Tomcat server.

Production-ready Features: It includes several production-ready features, like health checks, metrics, and externalized configuration.

Actuator: The Spring Boot Actuator provides essential tools for monitoring and managing your application in production, such as health checks, metrics, and environment details.


Architecture
Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring Framework, but it simplifies the process by reducing the need for extensive configuration. Here's a typical structure of a Spring Boot application:

Application Class: Contains the main() method that serves as the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
Controllers: Handle incoming HTTP requests, often used with @RestController or @Controller annotations.
Services: Contain business logic and are annotated with @Service.
Repositories: Provide an abstraction over database access, often using Spring Data JPA.
Configuration: Application configuration can be managed through application.properties or application.yml.


Commonly Used Spring Boot Modules
Spring Boot Web: Allows you to create web applications, including RESTful services using Spring MVC.

Spring Data JPA: Provides easy integration with relational databases by simplifying database operations using JPA (Java Persistence API).

Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization for securing applications.

Spring Boot Actuator: Adds monitoring and management endpoints like /health, /metrics, etc.

Spring Boot DevTools: Enhances the development experience by enabling hot-reloading of changes and additional debugging support.



Benefits of Using Spring Boot
Faster Development: Spring Boot reduces the time needed to configure and set up the application by providing default configurations.

Embedded Server: No need to deploy on a separate server (like Tomcat or Jetty), as Spring Boot applications come with an embedded server.

Microservices: It's great for building microservices due to its simplicity and ease of deployment.

Ecosystem Integration: Seamless integration with various Spring projects such as Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Batch, etc.



Spring Boot is a powerful framework for developing Java-based applications quickly and efficiently. Its ability to streamline configuration, handle dependencies, and provide production-ready features makes it an excellent choice for microservices, RESTful web services, and even full-stack applications.
