if you are writing a testcase for a function which makes http calls inside and that function is being called in ngOnInit then you should mock the response in beforeEach() that means before the fixture.detectChanges() executes you have to mock the response.

it('render data in UI',() => {
  component.preloadProductSettings();
  expect(component.b4pub_value).toEqual(data[0].value);
})

beforeEach(() => {
    fixture = TestBed.createComponent(ProductSettingsComponent);
    component = fixture.componentInstance;
    spyproductSettingsService.getProductSettingsValues.and.returnValue(of(data));
    fixture.detectChanges();
  });


  like this!.
