only storing few details in elastic search like price,title to show in search page.

when you searched for paperback isbn elastic search will give bindings isbns also.

in between ui and elastic search there is a service which is getting the requirements from ui and converting into a query to elastic search readable format and gets the response from elastic search.
that service will converts the response as well in a readable format.
that service will discards the irrelevant info
the service is routledge-product-service-api.

showquery=1;

/products
this api will give results of multipla isbns at a time.

/search/series
for finding series page.

for debug purpose take the query and hit the /search/complex api in local

changes made to products were first updated in sql then updated in elastic search

who were updating ES ?
we have an service routledge-product-api-sync

sync api will take the data from sql and update the same fields in elastic search

sync api will be updated whenever pcm sends some products to sql database


elastic search does not contains all product information.

you can add new fields in ES by adding a field.
by adding properties to ProductDocument
to add a field we should create a new mapping.x

/indexer will take multiple isbns as input and index the products and updates in ES


/_count will give you all the products that are indexed.

/_settings 


to create a new index from the existing index remove uuid,createddate

creating an index is a put api.

when you created a new index count of documents will be 0;

once you have indexed isbns then you will get isbns count.

once the isbn had indexed then you can see the data.

how sale by isbn is working ?
