Good morning everyone, my name is Raviteja, and I am delighted to be here today. I have nearly 3 years of experience in full-stack development, working with technologies such as ReactJS and Java.

Currently, I am working at Tricon Infotech as a Software Engineer, where I have been responsible for creating microservices and developing front-end applications for Routledge.com. This role has allowed me to gain valuable skills in API development and microservices architecture.

Prior to this, I served as an Associate Software Engineer in the same company, where i'm responsible for developing full stack solutios for routledge ecommerce admintool, which is an internal tool.

during my journey at tricon one of the biggest contribution I've made is developing the Product Helper application. I was deeply involved in building this application from scratch, where I implemented REST APIs and integrated them into the front end. This experience helped me gain expertise in API implementation and React development.

yeah that's all about myself,Thank you for the opportunity.
