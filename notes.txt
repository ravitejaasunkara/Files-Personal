ngOnInit()
once the component has loaded in DOM then that component constructor() will be called then that
component OnInit() will be called.

ngOnDestroy()
this will be called once the component has removed from the DOM,when the component is destroyed from the DOM
we can do any cleanig activities in ngOnDestroy() like unsubscribing from the observables after changing
the route like that.

ngOnChnges()
It will be fired whenever we are sending data from parent and whenever the data in parent has changed
then this will be called. it has a parameter caalled SimpleChanges which gives a list of changes.
it is not a good practice to make any expensive operations like API calls in ngOnChanges().

ngDoCheck() will trigger the changes have made.
