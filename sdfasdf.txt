For the loader issue
I did like cancelling the previous API calls if we navigate from oone route to another route,
if we navigate from Currency Exchange Rate to MONTHLY/WEB ORDER REPORT then the API calls in CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES will be cancelled,

but it is working partially like only 1 out of 4 API calls in CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES are cancelling if we navigate from CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES
to another component may be because of the sequential API calling in CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

It works fine if we navigate from MONTHLY ORDER REPORT Report to WEB ORDER REPORT since there is only one API call in MONTHLY ORDER REPORT so whenever we
navigate from MONTHLY ORDER REPORT to another COMPONENT then that one API call will be cancelled.

so it works fine incase from MONTHLY ORDER REPORT - ANOTHER COMPONENT

I tried once by removing the sequential API calling in CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES then it works fine,
it is cancelling all the  4 API calls in CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES when we navigate from CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES to another component 
incase of the non-synchronous API calling.

need a small fix of how to cancel all the 4 calls in CER then it's finished
