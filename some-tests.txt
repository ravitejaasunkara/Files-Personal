In describe 
let component:AppComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<AppComponent>;

In BeforeEach() 

fixture = TestBed.createComponent(AppComponent);
component = fixture.componentInstance;

beforeEach(async() => {

})
is different from 

beforeEach(()=>{

})

we have to place lines 7,8 inside beforeEach(() => {} ) not inside beforeEach(async() => {} )

//adding service to the testbed
spyOn() is used to create a dummy function which returns a dummy values.

spyOn is used to check when we are calling a function and if we wants to check if the inner function is being called or not
then we use spy on to check inner function is called or not

spyOn(servicename,function name).and.returnValue(false);
we can explicitly return a dummy value from a function using spyOn functionality.
