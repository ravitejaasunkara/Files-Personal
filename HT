whenever any issue with pcm events then go to old admin tool and db and check if the product exists or not,
if not exists then it could be an issue with pcm-processor that pcm processor failed to process the data that is being sent by the pcm
so now go to ecs then search for pcm and in dev or uat or prod check  logs for that isbn which is not getting processed.

if you want to send a pcm message for testing purpose go to aws and sqs and then enter the palyload that you want to send.
then it will be processed and appear in our db.

the flow is like 

pcm sends payload -> active mq -> pcm processor -> s3 bucket -> our db.

issus with pcm go and check logs in ecs pcm instance for your environmanet.
