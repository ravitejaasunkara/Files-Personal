HOW TO SEND DATA FROM PARENT TO CHILD IN ANGUAR

1.IN parent.component.ts file declare the fields that you want to send to chhild.
2.NOW BIND THE FIELDS TO CHILD SELECTOR AS OPEN parent.component.html AND INSIDE TO IT place
the child selector and bind the data to the child selector like - 
<app-child [parentData]="name"></app-child>
here name is the field that you want to send from parent to child where as [parentData] is any variable
that we use to bind the data fields.
3.now go to child and accept the data by decalring the field as 
@Input() parentData;
now the data is sent from parent and received in child.


SENDING DATA FROM CHILD TO PARENT
can be done as follows
-go to child.component.ts and declare like @Output sendingDataToParent = new EventEmitter();
-now declare a button child.component.html and declare a button to raise the eventemitter.
-the button will call a function on click event like this " this.sendingDataToParent.emit('sending data
from parent') 
-whatever you have placed inside emit we are sending that data.
-now in parent.component.html take the child selector and add like
-<app-child (sendingDataToParent)="data=$event"></app-child>
-declare the field "data" in parent.component.ts 
-that's it we got the data from child to parent.



this child-parent relationship we can also use to ngOnChanges(){} to detect the changes made in parent 
will be reflected in child;

add a input tag in parent and send the data which is entered in input tag,whenever we made changes the
changes are displayed in ngOnChanges() SimpleChanges Object.
