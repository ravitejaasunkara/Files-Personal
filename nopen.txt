I have few components in my angular app,so i have made a global loading spinner following your video,and it works fine but there is small issue exists,it is
Let's say i have components A,B,C.
component A makes a big http call and it does takes around 1minute to fetch the data,
Component B also makes an api call and it takes
around 20seconds to gets the data,
If i click on component A and then immediately i click on component B then component B loads its data in 20seconds and after component B
loads its data the spinner is not stopped loading,it is loading continuosly for 1minute(loading until component A gets the data) and after component A 
gets it's data then the spinner stops loading.
I don't want the spinner to be loaded in component B after B gets it's data,I dont want the spinner to wait for A to load it's data.
i hope you understand this and clarify my doubt,thanks for the reply...




for more better understanding, My "component A" makes an API call and gets it's data after 1minute so the loading spinner spins for 1minute

And My "component C" does not makes any API calls it's just an "about us" page with no API calls just a static page.

so now if i click on COMPONENT A and immediately clicks on COMPONENT C then the loading spinner is showing in COMPOONENT C even if the COMPONENT C is a static page 
with no API calls.
the spinner of COMPONENT A is loading in COMPONENT C until the COMPONENT A gets it's data.
once component A gets the data then the spinner stops displaying in COMPONENT C
