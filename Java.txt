It's great that you're looking to strengthen your fundamentals in Java while working with Spring Boot. Here are some key areas you might want to focus on to build a strong foundation in Java:

### Core Java Concepts

1. **OOP Principles**:
   - **Encapsulation**: Understand how to bundle data and methods that operate on the data within one unit (class).
   - **Inheritance**: Learn how to derive new classes from existing ones, promoting code reuse.
   - **Polymorphism**: Know how methods can take on multiple forms (overloading and overriding).
   - **Abstraction**: Grasp how to hide the complex implementation details and show only the necessary features.

2. **Basic Syntax and Structure**:
   - **Variables and Data Types**: Primitive types vs. objects.
   - **Operators**: Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, etc.
   - **Control Structures**: if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while).

3. **Collections Framework**:
   - **Lists**: ArrayList, LinkedList.
   - **Sets**: HashSet, TreeSet.
   - **Maps**: HashMap, TreeMap.
   - **Queues**: PriorityQueue, LinkedList.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - **Try-Catch-Finally**: How to handle exceptions.
   - **Custom Exceptions**: Creating and using custom exceptions.
   - **Checked vs Unchecked Exceptions**.

5. **Java 8 and Beyond**:
   - **Lambdas and Functional Interfaces**.
   - **Streams API**: How to work with collections and other data sources using a functional approach.
   - **Optional**: Handling optional values to avoid null checks.

6. **Multithreading and Concurrency**:
   - **Thread Creation**: Extending `Thread` class vs implementing `Runnable` interface.
   - **Synchronization**: Locks, volatile keyword.
   - **Concurrency Utilities**: Executors, CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier, Concurrent Collections.

### Spring Boot Concepts

1. **Spring Framework Basics**:
   - **Dependency Injection**: Understand how Spring manages dependencies.
   - **Bean Lifecycle**: How beans are created and managed.
   - **Annotations**: Common annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Autowired`, `@Qualifier`.

2. **Spring Boot Fundamentals**:
   - **Configuration**: Application properties, YAML configuration.
   - **Spring Boot Starters**: Pre-configured templates to quickly add dependencies.
   - **Auto-Configuration**: How Spring Boot auto-configures beans and settings based on the classpath.

3. **Creating REST APIs**:
   - **Controllers**: `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
   - **Request and Response Handling**: `@RequestBody`, `@ResponseBody`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`.
   - **Exception Handling**: `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`.

4. **Data Access**:
   - **Spring Data JPA**: `@Entity`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Repository`, `CrudRepository`, `JpaRepository`.
   - **Transactions**: `@Transactional`.
   - **Database Configurations**: Setting up data sources and configuring database connections.

5. **Security**:
   - **Spring Security Basics**: Authentication and authorization.
   - **Security Configurations**: Customizing security settings.

6. **Testing**:
   - **Unit Testing**: Using JUnit and Mockito.
   - **Integration Testing**: Using Spring's testing support.

### Recommended Resources

1. **Books**:
   - *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch.
   - *Java: The Complete Reference* by Herbert Schildt.
   - *Spring in Action* by Craig Walls.

2. **Online Courses**:
   - **Udemy**: "Java Programming Masterclass" by Tim Buchalka.
   - **Coursera**: "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals" by Duke University.
   - **Pluralsight**: Various Java and Spring Boot courses.

3. **Documentation**:
   - [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
   - [Spring Framework Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/)
   - [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/)

### Practice

- **Coding Exercises**: Solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal.
- **Projects**: Work on small projects to apply what you learn. For example, create a simple CRUD application using Spring Boot.

### Asking for Help

- **Forums**: Participate in communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/java, and the Spring community forums.
- **Colleagues**: Don't hesitate to ask your colleagues for explanations or guidance on concepts you're unsure about.

By focusing on these areas, you'll build a solid understanding of both Java and Spring Boot, enabling you to confidently answer theoretical questions and apply your knowledge effectively in your projects.



COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK.
--------------------------------------------------------------
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a powerful annotation in Spring Boot that combines three annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. Here's a beginner-friendly explanation of each part:

@Configuration: This annotation indicates that the class is a source of bean definitions for the application context. In simpler terms, it declares that this class provides configuration settings for the application.

@EnableAutoConfiguration: This annotation tells Spring Boot to automatically configure your application based on its dependencies and the environment. It attempts to guess and configure beans that you are likely to need, based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

@ComponentScan: This annotation tells Spring to scan and discover components (such as controllers, services, repositories, etc.) automatically, starting from the package where the application class is located. Components are typically Java classes annotated with @Component or its specialized variants like @Controller, @Service, etc.
