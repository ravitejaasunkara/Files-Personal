login to aws ec2 from powershell -
first go to path where key.pem file is located
enter command in powershell - ssh -i filename(key-pair name) ec2-user@public ip idress from created ec2 instance in aws ece

default path - /var/lib

install docker -y to install docker in linux

systemctl start docker - to start docker in linux.

systmctl stop docker - stop docker

yum install tree - to install tree structure to view the files foldersetc..,

remove a directory -> rm -rf [directory-name]

systemctl status docker -> to check docker status.

rsync -aqxp /var/lib/docker /new/vinay/docker -> to sync all your new changes to your required path

systemctl deamon-reload -> to reload the docker engine.

docker volume create ravi -> to create a docker voulme.

docker pull httpd

even the docker was uninstalled all the voulmes and images still exists not gone.

yum remove docker -y -> to uninstall docker

yum install docker -> to install docker.

systemctl start docker -> to start docker engine.

docker pull httpd -> pulling httpd image

docker run -it -d --name cont1 --volume ravi:/tmp httpd /bin/bash -> to create a container and attatch the volume ravi to container cont1;

defaault path where all the docker things were saved -> /var/lib/systemd/system/docker.service -> to change the path go to docker.service file and then add your path at ExecStart start your path after docker d like -g /new/vinay/docker

before that stop the docker engine with command -> systemctl stop docker.service to stop all the docker services

to stop the socket use command docker.socket

before doing any changes stop docker engine
after did your changes start the docker engine. 

docker exec --it cont2 /bin/bash -> to run contaainer

go to path /new/vinay/docker 
then create a file then whatver the files created will comes under the container because the volume is attatched to that container.

to mount a directory from one place to another place use command -> docker run -it -d --name cont3 --mount type=bind,src=/root/sync,dst=/tmp httpd /bin/bash
-sync is directory name created using mkdir sync.
-src = host path 
-dst = container path.

docker volume inspect [volume-name] - inspect is used to check all the details 

shared volume

linking a volume from one container to another container

docker run -it -d --name cont4 --privileged=true --volumes-from cont2 httpd /bin/bash

that is how you caan share volume with another container

now try writing some data into cont2

docker exec -it cont4 /bin/bash
ls
go inside v1 - cd v1
ls
touch my1

file created in cont2 now go to cont4 to check my1 also synced to cont4 or not as it is using the shared volume

apt-get install git and yum install git are same.

creating an new image from an exisitng container and then if we create a new container from the new image then all the data from the old contianer will be copied to new container.

docker commit cont6 vinay:v1

new image[vinay:v1] will be created from cont6.

docker exec -d cont7 mkdir udp

docker network ls -> to check all available networks

docker create volume - to create a volume

docker run -it -d --name cont8 --mount type=bind,src=/root/sync,dst=/tmp --network vinay --cpus 0.25 --expose 8081/tcp --hostname vinay --memory 6mb --pull centos


docker run -it -d --name cont1 -p 80:80/tcp httpdimage:new /bin/bash
docker exec -it cont1 /bin/bash

docker volume ls-> to check the list of volume created.

docker volume create [volume-nam] ->  to create a volume in docker.
docker volume create ravi1 -> here ravi1 is a volume created.

all the docker related stuff stored in the path /var/lib/docker here we can see all the things like the containers,volumes,images and everything.

cd ~ -> to go to the root path.


docker run -it -d --name cont2 -v ravi1 httpd
this is a command to create a new container and attatch a volume which is already created.
-ravi1 is the volume which was previously created.

docker run -it -d -v volume1:/tmp --name cont10 httpd
creating a new container named cont10 from image httpd and attatching the volume[volume1] to it


how to go inside a docker container
docker exec -it hello /bin/bash
here hello is the container name

achieving shared volume in docker containers
here we are using the same volume for multiple containers
first create a volume 
	docker volume create volume1
now create the container and mounting the volume1 to it
	docker run -it -d -v volume1 --name container1 httpd
	so here we have a container created and volume1 is attatched to the container.
now create another container and mount volume1 to it.
	docker run -it -d -v volume1 --name container2 httpd
	so here we have a container created and volume1 is attached to the container.
	we can check that by going inside the container by the command mentioned in #L96
now if you create anything by going into container2 the same will be reflected in volume1 and if you create anything in container1 also the things will be stored in volume1 because here volume1 acts as a shared volume.
